// Time Complexity : O(N) each nodes will be visited once
// Space Complexity : O(log(N)) if we don't consider result. 
	//The calls in calling stack may reach h if h denotes to the length of the deepest path in the tree. 
	//So itâ€™s space complexity is O(h). Or you can say O(logn) because h is bounded by logn.

//recursion
//in recursive function, base case is if node is null return nothing.
//keep adding the nodes in the current list
//else if leaf node reached and sum equals to node.val then add current list as new arraylist to the result "paths" list
//repeat for left and right nodes
//remember to remove stack on end of each recursive call
