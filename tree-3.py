#Space Complexity: O(n^2) copy of elements each time
#Did it work on leetcode:
'''
Brute force: test each path from the top, save in an array, if it adds to sum append it to array
'''

'''
Main idea:
Similar to previous problem, we the present array in the call stack , add
the next value, when we reach the leaf, we sum all the elements in array and check it it's valid.
We could just keep the sum, and if it's a valid branch go up until the root and save it, although it would save
space in the callstack, seems too complicated for not much added.

#Did it work on leetcode:  yes

'''
Main idea:
Instead of passing a copy, we can just pop an element if both
iterations have been terminated. In other words, the order of how the elements are appended to list is the same
as how they are in the call stack. So when we pop an element from the call stack
if we pop it from the list, the next last element of list is exactly the next
element in the call stack, exactly what we need since we want our list to keep
track of what had been visited until that last element in the stack.
To visualize it, first time we arrived at a certain element, or when we return
to this element after poping from the stack, the state of the stack is the same.
Also the list of elements first time we visited that element, or when we pop
and go back to this element, it should be exactly the same. What's in List is
what's in my call stack at that point.

#Problem 2: Symmetric Tree
#Time Complexity: O(n)
#Space Complexity: O(h) call stack
#Did it work on leetcode:  yes

'''
Brute force
Reconstruct the tree by going through each path,but right becomes left.
Compare the tree with the original.
'''
'''
Main idea:
We start from the two subtrees (t1,t2) left and right from the top, we check if they have the same value,
if so we check if t1.left has the same value as t2.right, and t1.right with t2.left. If so , we check
continue doing so until the end. If we encounter a problem we return False, if everything was passed,
we return true. basically, given two trees at the same level, when we grow something to the left,
the other one should grow something to the right. To visualize it , see what one single branch and it's symmetric counterpart
is doing it, if I start from two heads. If the branch goes left, on my other head it should go right, then the path of the first branch should always be opposite to the path of the other branch all the way down. It's the same as saying, compare
the next move of the node right with the node left of the other tree. Always compare with the opposite. That's what
we're doing in the recursion
