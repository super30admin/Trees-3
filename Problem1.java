/** Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
Return:

[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
] */

// Time Complexity : O(n) as it traverses and visits each node
// Space Complexity : O(h)?? as we are storing references of addresses. so we keep mutating values in a list as it comes, but we need to one more list to store our actual sum list
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
//Approach-We will be looking for a path(until leaf node) that will provide sum equal to path-sum(given as 22)
//so we will allocate a list and traverses each node starting from root until it reaches leaf node and simulatenously finding the difference from the target path sum
//once we reach the last node, if it equals the difference, then we can keep that list as it satisfies our path sum
//additionally, we will backtrack if the difference is not equal with the leaf node
